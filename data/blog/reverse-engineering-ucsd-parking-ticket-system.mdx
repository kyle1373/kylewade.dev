## Overview

In this article, I detail how I reverse engineered UCSD's parking ticket system to uncover how citations are issued and stored. This investigation led to the creation of a website that tracked the locations of parking tickets being issued in real time all across campus, which eventually got shut down by the university. Despite this, the project demonstrated a vulnerability in a widespread ticketing infrastructure used by hundreds of universities today.

## Discovering a Pattern

A few weeks ago, my friend showed me his $80 parking ticket he got at UCSD. In the screenshot, I noticed something interesting...

![Parking Tickets 1](/static/blog/reverse-engineering-ucsd/parking_tickets_1.png)

If you didn't catch it at first, don't worry. Let me show you another picture that makes it a little more obvious. Pay attention to the citation number and issue date columns.

![Parking Tickets 2](/static/blog/reverse-engineering-ucsd/parking_tickets_2.png)

In this screenshot, I noticed that older parking tickets have lower citation numbers than later ones, sorted in ascending order. It could be a coincidence, but since there's 4 in a row, this seemed very unlikely. I suspected that some form of auto incrementing was going on with the parking ticket's citation numbers. Very interesting...let's look into it further.

## Exploiting an Unauthenticated System

UCSD has a website which allows anyone to pay their parking tickets by looking up a citation number. The website is completely unauthed, meaning anyone can access the site without being logged in or creating an account. This is perfect for people who aren't affiliated with UCSD and need to pay their parking tickets. For me, this was a perfect opportunity to test my hypothesis.

![UCSD Parking Ticket Homepage](/static/blog/reverse-engineering-ucsd/homepage.png)

So we know that <b>15207413515</b> is a valid citation number. Let's enter it on this website and see what we get...

![UCSD Parking Ticket Paid](/static/blog/reverse-engineering-ucsd/homepage_paid.png)

As expected, we can see that the citation has already been paid through an error message popup. Now let's increment that number by 1 and try <b>1520741351<span className="text-green-400">6</span></b>...

![UCSD Parking Ticket Paid](/static/blog/reverse-engineering-ucsd/homepage_paid.png)

Strange. This citation also shows that it has been paid. I tried this with <b>1520741351<span className="text-green-400">7</span></b>, <b>1520741351<span className="text-green-400">8</span></b>, <b>1520741351<span className="text-green-400">9</span></b>, and so on. All of these citations were already paid for. Just to be certain, I tried a really high citation number that I thought was invalid, like <b>152074<span className="text-red-400">99999</span></b>.

![UCSD Parking Ticket Validation Error](/static/blog/reverse-engineering-ucsd/homepage_validation_error.png)

This time a different error message appears, which showed that the citation did not exist in their system. This meant that the website does a database lookup on every parking ticket search. Since the lower parking ticket numbers were valid yet the later parking ticket numbers were invalid, I was more convinced that some form of auto incrementing was going on. This got me wondering â€“ what happens if we get the largest citation number that is still a valid ticket? Will it be a ticket issued recently?

## Implementing a Binary Search to Find Recent Tickets

We know that this citation number is somewhere between <b>15207400000</b> and <b>15207499999</b> based on our previous lookups assuming that citation numbers are in sorted order. To find this boundary number efficiently, I wrote a program which performs a binary search between <b>15207400000</b> through <b>15207499999</b> and checks if the ticket exists through querying the API. If the parking ticket exists, move forward. If the parking ticket does not exist, move backwards.

```python

def citation_exists(citation_id):
    base_url = "https://ucsd-transportation.t2hosted.com/Account/Citations/Search"

    headers = {
        "accept": "*/*",

    }

    response = requests.post(base_url, headers=headers, data=data)

    # Check if '/Account/Citations/Results' is in the response. If so, the ticket exists.
    return "/Account/Citations/Results" in response.text

def find_latest_citation(start_id = 15207400000, max_increment = 10000):
    low = start_id
    high = start_id + max_increment

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2

        # Check if the certain citation number exists
        if citation_exists(mid):
            print(mid, "does exist. Moving forward...")

            # If exists, try a larger number
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            print(mid, "does not exist. Moving backward...")

            # If does not exist, try a smaller number
            high = mid - 1

    # When the loop finishes, `high` should be the latest valid citation number
    return high
```

![Performing a Binary Search](/static/blog/reverse-engineering-ucsd/binary_search.png)

Our binary search found <b>15207422649</b> to be the latest citation number. Let's enter that into the website...

![Parking Ticket 15207422649](/static/blog/reverse-engineering-ucsd/15207422649.png)

Not only was this an unpaid parking citation, but this was a parking citation issued <b>TODAY</b> (9/13/2024). The location of the parking ticket, the parking ticket fee, the (censored) license plate, and payment status were also given.

If I decremented the citation number to <b>1520742264<span className="text-red-400">8</span></b> and looked it up, I got another valid parking citation with a recent issue date. This confirmed my suspicion that UCSD auto increments their citation numbers.

So now I have all the tools needed to get UCSD's unpaid parking tickets in their database. I just need to create a script which looks up a citation number, scrapes the HTML using Selenium, and decrements the citation number in a loop.

```python
def check_for_error_message(driver):
    # This function checks if there is an error message that appeared in the HTML after looking up a citation.

            EC.url_contains("/Account/Citations/Results")

```

I also created a website to display this data.

![ucsdtickets.com version 1](/static/blog/reverse-engineering-ucsd/ucsdtickets_ver1.png)

I kept this script going for a few hours and got <b>462</b> valid parking citations. As we can see, Athena parking structure and Campus Point East are areas which UCSD issues a lot of parking tickets.

However, there was one thing that was still bothering me: while I knew <b>15207400001</b> and <b>15207306439</b> were valid citation numbers, <b>15207399999</b> was not a valid citation number, despite it being between these two numbers. Somehow there were gaps in the auto incrementing pattern. It would take me a good 30 or so minutes, but I would eventually also figure this out. To explain this, let us finally break down citation numbers once and for all.

## Understanding Citation Number Structure

Let's take the following citation number:

<b>
  <span className="text-blue-400">152</span>
  <span className="text-orange-400">073</span>
  <span className="text-green-400">06439</span>
</b>

Citation numbers are composed of 3 parts. The first 3 numbers are always going to be <b className="text-blue-400">152</b>, which I suppose is UCSD specific. The next 3 numbers are what's called the <b className="text-orange-400">Device ID</b>, which is the ID of device that the citation was issued with. The final 5 digits make up the <b className="text-green-400">Report Number</b> which is auto incremented among each device.

So for instance, <b><span className="text-blue-400">152</span><span className="text-orange-400">073</span><span className="text-green-400">06439</span></b> means that this citation is done on device 73, and it is the 6,439th citation given out on that device.

After figuring this out, I performed a binary search on each device to see what the latest citation number was for each of them. I figured out that there were 93 different devices, meaning that the device number could be between 001 and 093.

```python
def find_latest_citations_for_all_devices(region_num=152, max_increment=99999):
    results = {}
    
    # Loop through device numbers from 1 to 93
    for device_num in range(1, 94):
        ticket_num = 1
        citation_num = region_num * 100000000 + device_num * 100000 + ticket_num
        
        print(f"Searching for device_num {device_num} starting from {citation_num}")
        latest_citation = find_latest_citation(citation_num, max_increment)
        results[f"device_{device_num}"] = latest_citation
        
        print(f"Device {device_num}: Latest citation found is {latest_citation}")

    # Write the results to a JSON file
    with open('latest_citations.json', 'w') as json_file:
        json.dump(results, json_file, indent=4)
    
    return results
```
```json:latest_citations.json
{
    "device_1": 15200119982,
    "device_2": 15200203670,
    "device_3": 15200316008,
    "device_4": 15200400001,
    "device_5": 15200500000,
    "device_6": 15200647499,
    "device_7": 15200700000,
    "device_8": 15200818437,
    "device_9": 15200906846,
    "device_10": 15201029610,
    // more here...
    "device_89": 15208900011,
    "device_90": 15209001322,
    "device_91": 15209100000,
    "device_92": 15209200000,
    "device_93": 15209300059
}
```

Now that we've fully cracked the algorithm, how could we take advantage of this?

Well, what if we created a real time tracker of tickets being issued live on campus?

## Creating a Real Time Citation Tracker

The premise is pretty straightforward. Now that we know that citation numbers are predictable, we just need to write a script which constantly checks if a valid ticket exists for the next expected citation number for each device. Once it exists, we pull the data and push it to the database, then move on to the next citation number on that device. This creates a real time system which listens to new tickets being issued all across campus at UCSD.

```python

def load_latest_citations():
    """Load the latest citations from the JSON file."""
    with open("latest_citations.json", "r") as json_file:
        return json.load(json_file)


def save_latest_citations(latest_citations):
    """Save the updated latest citations to the JSON file."""
    with open("latest_citations.json", "w") as json_file:
        json.dump(latest_citations, json_file, indent=4)


def scrape_new_citations():
    """Continuously check for new citations on each device and process them."""
    latest_citations = (
        load_latest_citations()
    )  # Load the latest citations from the file

    for device, citation_id in latest_citations.items():
        next_citation_id = (
            citation_id + 1
        )  # Start with the next citation number

        while True:
            # Handle the citation and check if it was successfully inserted
            citation_handled = check_and_insert_citation(
                next_citation_id
            )

            if citation_handled:
                print("New citation found and inserted!")

                # Update the latest citation ID for this device
                latest_citations[device] = next_citation_id

                # Save the updated citation data back to the JSON file
                save_latest_citations(latest_citations)

                # Increment to try the next citation immediately
                next_citation_id += 1
            else:
                print(f"No more new citations for {device}. Last known: {next_citation_id - 1}")
                break  # Exit the while loop when no new citation is found

def run_scrape_new_citations_thread():
    """Runs scrape_new_citations function in a separate thread."""
    while True:
        try:
            scrape_new_citations()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error in scrape_new_citations: {e}")

```

After creating this new real time scraper, I added a few new features to the site, such as searching tickets by location and device number.

![ucsdtickets.com version 2](/static/blog/reverse-engineering-ucsd/ucsdtickets_ver2.png)

It worked like clockwork. I was super excited and looked forward to the novel types of insights that would be gained from analyzing this data after a few months. Unfortunately, this scraping would be tragically cut short.

## Everything Comes Crashing Down

A week after starting my initial real time scraping, someone discovered my website and posted about it on UCSD's subreddit.

![r/ucsd Reddit Post](/static/blog/reverse-engineering-ucsd/reddit_post.png)

Truthfully, I have no idea who posted this, as I only told a few of my close friends about the website. Maybe they told their friends and that's how it went public, or Google may have indexed my site and somehow got it on the search results. In any case, a lot of eyes were on my website.

![ucsdtickets.com Analytics](/static/blog/reverse-engineering-ucsd/ucsdtickets_analytics.png)

While this was cool publicity, I knew this was going to destroy my website, as UCSD would eventually discover my web scraping and figure out a way to disable it. As expected, what they did next would bring this entire operation to an end.

![UCSD patches their citation website](/static/blog/reverse-engineering-ucsd/homepage_broken.png)

UCSD changed their parking citation website to require BOTH a citation number and license plate to look up a parking ticket. Since there is no way for me to figure out a citation number's license plate, this scraping method no longer worked, and I was forced to shut it down.

For the 1 week that my scraper ran, <b>665</b> tickets were processed, totaling <b>\$56,900</b> in parking ticket fees with the most expensive parking ticket being <b>\$920</b>. You can view an archive of this data over at https://ucsdtickets.com. While I had a lot of fun reverse engineering the system, this was understandably a huge security issue for UCSD, and I fully back their decision in shutting down my website.

## Expanding the Scope to Other Institutions

Originally that's where the story would have ended. However, I recently discovered that UCSD's ticketing system is being hosted by another company, and there are other institutions who also use them...

![100+ websites which use the same parking ticket infrastructure](/static/blog/reverse-engineering-ucsd/similar_websites.png)

Over 100 different institutions, universities, colleges, and more use this exact same company to issue parking tickets. Curious, I checked out San Diego State University's (SDSU) parking ticket website to see if my real time ticket scraper worked on their website.

![SDSU parking ticket lookup](/static/blog/reverse-engineering-ucsd/sdsu_lookup.png)

Yep, it worked.

I won't bother with creating another real time system for SDSU or any other college that uses this company, so if you're interested in doing it yourself, my code is over at https://github.com/kyle1373/ucsd-ticket-scraper.

Thanks for reading :)
